During the inteview I was given the below topic with a code provide by an Intern from An England Finance compagny.
My assignment was to make a code review to the intern and provide my own version of this code
-- Topic --
VWAPer v0.1
// Read file in with the following format:
// [Stock],[Interval],[Volume Traded],[High],[Low]

// Calculate the total volume traded per Stock
// Calculate the total volume traded per Stock&Interval

// Write the total volume traded per Stock&Interval as a percentage of the total volume traded per Stock to stdout:
// [Stock],[Interval],[%Volume Traded]

// Write the delimiter '#' to stdout

// Write the maximum High and minimum Low for each Stock to stdout:
// [Stock],[Day High],[Day Low]

-- example input --
VOD.L 1 100 184 183.7
BT.LN 1 300 449.4 448.2
VOD.L 2 25 184.1 182.4
BT.LN 2 900 449.8 449.5

-- example output --
VOD.L,1,80q
BT.LN,1,25
VOD.L,2,20
BT.LN,2,75
#
VOD.L,184.1,182.4
BT.LN,449.8,448.2

--Topic explained with my own word --
It was asked to consider a stock data with the format [Stock],[Interval],[Volume Traded],[High],[Low] then complete the following steps in cpp:
-Read the file respecting the required format
- Compute volumes
- Compute volume in %
- write "#" to stdout
- write max high and min Low
-- assignment achieved --
1- Reviewed the intern code, gave advices to help him progress: The CodeReview file is 'Code_Review_Intern_stockmain.cpp'(this will not be excute properly, please refer to my own stockmain.cpp)
2- Proposed my own code for this program to make better here'stockmain.cpp'.
 2.a - How to EXCUTE MY CODE :
    . On Linux with g++(1y) I played :  g++ -g -Wall -Werror stockmain.cpp test_data -o a.out then ./a.out
    . On Window, visual studio code with c++ 11 or more, compile and excute stockmain.cpp don't forget to provide test_data.txt

Note :
- My discpline to aschieve this, I have spent 30 min each evening after completing my work day. I took me 1 week(2h and 30min)
- Feel free to also  give me review, I'ld be happy to learn again.
